# Wiki-GRx-Pipeline

![](pictures/7.png)

This repository provides a guidance for training GRx to walk on rough terrain using NVIDIA's Isaac Gym, legged_gym and rsl_rl libraries from Legged Robotics @ ETH ZÃ¼rich.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Anaconda
- NVIDIA GPU (Prefer GPU powerful than GTX 3060)
- NVIDIA Driver with CUDA higher than 11.0
- Python 3.8
- Isaac Gym
- legged_gym
- rsl_rl

## Pipeline

The pipeline of training GRx to walk on rough terrain can be divided into the following steps:

1. Prepare robot model:
    - https://gitee.com/FourierIntelligence/wiki-grx-models
    - This repository provides the GRx series robot models in URDF format.

2. Prepare walking policy:
    - https://gitee.com/FourierIntelligence/wiki-grx-gym
    - This repository provides the code for training walking policy for GRx in Isaac Gym.

3. Verify in simulator with ODE physics engine:
    - https://gitee.com/FourierIntelligence/wiki-grx-webots
    - This repository provides the code for verifying the walking policy in the simulator with ODE physics engine.
    - Use Webots as the simulator.

4. Deploy on real robot:
    - https://gitee.com/FourierIntelligence/wiki-grx-deploy
    - This repository provides the code for deploying the walking policy on the real robot.
